## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](Docs/Readme-images/Palette.png "Palette")

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

I chose the above colours to give the website a modern, clean and aestheticly pleasing website with a nice contract to give the user and owner a feeling of confidence that the website is built by a professional.

### Typography

In this project I have imported fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The fonts I choose are as follows.

1. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
2. [Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind)

Please note that the above fonts maybe shown in a writing system that is not the Latin writing system. When you click on the link please make sure that the 'writing system' is set to Latin to see the font in English.

* I choose the above fonts as they give the website a professional business feel with clean, crisp and modern look.
* I have included all variations that available for each font to give me the most versiatility on the website.

### Imagery

I have used images that convey information through said images. By using these images it allows for a user who may not have industry knowledge to easily be able to use the wesite as they will give the user a well known visiual that will allow them to pick the option that they want and not to get lost within the written information they may not want.

All images used on the website are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) website. I have credited each image aurthor in the [Credits](#credits) Section.

### Wireframes

Please find the wireframe designs for the home, services and contact us pages in mobile, tablet and desktop to show the full responsiveness built in from the start of the project below.

* [Home Page](Docs/wireframes/home-page/Home-Page.png)
* [Services Page](Docs/wireframes/service-page/Service-Page.png)
* [Contact Us Page](Docs/wireframes/contact-page/Contact-Page.png)
* [Thank You Page](Docs/wireframes/thank-you-page/Thank-You-Page.png)

## Features

The Website consists of 4 pages, the website has a home page, services page, contact and success page.

As this is the first deployment of the website I wanted to make sure that it contained all the important information to allow the user to understand and hopefully send through their information to begin building a business relationship.

All four pages contain the following features.

#### Navigation

The Navigation bar is one of the main features which allows the user to navigate through the website with ease. The navbar is fully connected to all pages on the website.

![Navbar screenshot from website](Docs/Readme-images/Navbar.png)

#### Footer

The footer is another feature which seen on all pages. The footer hold important information for user such as the address, social links and quick contact details, this information makes it easier for the user to contact us without having to use the contact page.

![Footer screenshot from website](Docs/Readme-images/Footer.png)

#### Favicon

The favicon can be seen on the navbar as the link to home on the right hand side and also on the tab are of the web browser, this give the website a small but important change which gives the user the feeling that the website was built professionaly.

![Favicon screenshot from website](Docs/Readme-images/favicon.png)

### General features on each page

#### Home Page

![Home page on multiple devices](Docs/Readme-images/Argoll-home-devices.png)

The home page contains the following.

Hero Image with company name.

The hero image gives a clear understanding to the user as to the company's area of business as well as having logistics in the name of the company.

![hero screenshot from home page](Docs/Readme-images/home-page-hero.png)

Card Section

Card section that is linked to the service page, each card is linked to the section of the service page to give the user a shortcut to the information they need.

![Card section screenshot from home page](Docs/Readme-images/home-page-card-shortcut.png)

About and history Section

The about and histroy section gives the user a small piece of information about the company and it's history. This allows the user to understand the size and length of time the company has been doing business.

![About and history section screenshot from home page](Docs/Readme-images/home-page-about.png)

#### Services Page

![Services page on multiple devices](Docs/Readme-images/Argoll-services-devices.png)

The services page contains the following.

Hero Section with Carousel

The hero section on the service page has changed from the home page but still carries the company name but also has the page title to give clear understanding of what page the user is on.

The carousel that has been added to the services page uses the same images from the card section on the home page to give a feeling of continuity to the user.

![Hero screenshoot from services page](Docs/Readme-images/services-page-hero.png)

Services info section

The services infomation section has a seperate section for each type of transport service offered (road, rail, air and sea). Each section has the image from the card section on the home page which is linked to the that section's infomation. Again this is to give the customer a feeling of knowing and continuity.

![services section screenshoot from services page](Docs/Readme-images/services-page-service-info-section.png)

#### Contact us Page

![Contact page on multiple devices](Docs/Readme-images/Argoll-contact-devices.png)

The services page contains the following.

Hero Image with company name and page title

The hero section on the contact page has the same design as the other hero sections on the website but with a different image to give the customer an easy visiual aid as to what page they are on.

![Hero screenshot from contact page](Docs/Readme-images/contact-page-hero.png)

Form Section

The form section of the page give the user the option to request a callback. With information provide will allow the company staff to begin the conversation with the user to start building a business relationship.

![Form screenshot from contact page](Docs/Readme-images/contact-page-form.png)

Office Address Section

The office address section is a basic card layout with all the relevant information for each of the company's offices, this allows the user to also contact their local office.

![Office address screenshot from contact page](Docs/Readme-images/contact-page-office-details.png)

#### Success Page

![Success page on multiple devices](Docs/Readme-images/Argoll-thank-you-devices.png)

The success page contains the following.

Hero Image

The hero section on the success page is the same as the contact page as this is only an extension of the contact page form.

![Hero screenshot from the success page](Docs/Readme-images/success-page-hero.png)

Thank You Section

The thank you section on the success page has a small thank you message to let the user know the information in the form has been sent to the company. There is also a button to return to the home page.

![Thank you section screenshot from the success page](Docs/Readme-images/success-page-thank-you.png)

### Future Implementations

I would like to add a schedule page to give the user important information about how long it takes for their deliveries to get to certain countries. I would do this by building a form that once complete would pull information from a database and only show the relevant data to the user.

I would also like to add a map with pins on it to show the offices locations in an easy to understand format on the contact page.

### Accessibility

I have used icons and added aria-labels on the footer for the social media links, I also added aria-label to the logo on the navbar. This allows screen readers to understand what the icons are for.

### Content

The information was taken from two logistics websites.

The about and history section was taken from [Owens-Group]{https://www.owensgroup.uk/about}. The reason for using this contant on my website is that Argoll Logistics is a fictional company and this website will never be used by a real business.

The information on the services page was taken from [Inbound-Logistics](https://www.inboundlogistics.com/article/transportation-in-logistics/). I used this content as this information is general knowledge and would not come under copyright law and as explained in the above parapgraph this is a fictional company.
