Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

`First Time Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to take part in a pub quiz online and improve my general knowledge. I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere. | The Quiz Arms pulls general knowledge quiz questions from a large variety of topics, much like a pub quiz would do. The site is available for use whenever is convenient to the user. |
| I want the site to be responsive to my device. | I have developed the site with responsiveness in mind. |
| I want the site to be easy to navigate. | Buttons are used throughout the site for navigation, much like a mobile app. As the site is like a mobile app - I decided that I didn't want to add a navigation bar or footer, as these would make the site look more like a traditional webpage. The page title also acts as a link to the home page.  |

`Returning Visitors`

|  Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to choose a level of difficulty that I feel is appropriate for me, based on my experience from my first visit to the site. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |

`Frequent Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to adjust the difficulty level to keep improving my knowledge. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |
| I want to be able to log my high scores to see how I am performing. | Users of the site are able to log their high scores to the high scores page. The top ten results will be displayed. |
